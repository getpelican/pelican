Settings
########

Pelican is configurable thanks to a configuration file you can pass to
the command line::

    $ pelican content -s path/to/your/settingsfile.py

(If you used the `pelican-quickstart` command, your primary settings file will be named `pelicanconf.py` by default.)

Settings are configured in the form of a Python module (a file). There is an
`example settings file
<https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/raw/master/samples/pelican.conf.py>`_
available for reference.

All the setting identifiers must be set in all-caps, otherwise they will not be
processed. Setting values that are numbers (5, 20, etc.), booleans (True,
False, None, etc.), dictionaries, or tuples should *not* be enclosed in
quotation marks. All other values (i.e., strings) *must* be enclosed in
quotation marks.

Unless otherwise specified, settings that refer to paths can be either absolute
or relative to the configuration file.

The settings you define in the configuration file will be passed to the
templates, which allows you to use your settings to add site-wide content.

Here is a list of settings for Pelican:

Basic settings

                                                                                 here. See the "Date format and locales" section below for details.
`USE_FOLDER_AS_CATEGORY` (``True``)                                              When you don't specify a category in your post metadata, set this

                                                                                 ``DEFAULT_CATEGORY`` will be used as a fallback.

                                                                                 setting.

                                                                                 be generated by passing the tuple to the
                                                                                 ``datetime.datetime`` constructor.

                                                                                 and pages.

                                                                                 from the filename. All named groups that are matched
                                                                                 will be set in the metadata object.
                                                                                 The default value will only extract the date from
                                                                                 the filename.

                                                                                 date and the slug, you could set something like:
                                                                                 ``'(?P<date>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})_(?P<slug>.*)'``.
                                                                                 See :ref:`path_metadata`.
`PATH_METADATA` (``''``)                                                         Like ``FILENAME_METADATA``, but parsed from a page's
                                                                                 full path relative to the content source directory.
                                                                                 See :ref:`path_metadata`.

                                                                                 unnecessary files from persisting in your output. However, **this is
                                                                                 a destructive setting and should be handled with extreme care.**

                                                                                 control data. For example: ``(".hg", ".git", ".bzr")``
`JINJA_EXTENSIONS` (``[]``)                                                      A list of any Jinja2 extensions you want to use.
`JINJA_FILTERS` (``{}``)                                                         A list of custom Jinja2 filters you want to use.
                                                                                 The dictionary should map the filtername to the filter function.
                                                                                 For example: ``{'urlencode': urlencode_filter}``
                                                                                 See `Jinja custom filters documentation`_.

                                                                                 here or a single string representing one locale.
                                                                                 When providing a list, all the locales will be tried
                                                                                 until one works.

                                                                                 the default ``['.#*']`` will ignore emacs lock files.
`MD_EXTENSIONS` (``['codehilite(css_class=highlight)','extra']``)                A list of the extensions that the Markdown processor
                                                                                 will use. Refer to the Python Markdown documentation's
                                                                                 `Extensions section <http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/>`_

`OUTPUT_SOURCES_EXTENSION` (``.text``)                                           Controls the extension that will be used by the SourcesGenerator.
                                                                                 Defaults to ``.text``. If not a valid string the default value

`PLUGINS` (``[]``)                                                               The list of plugins to load. See :ref:`plugins`.

URL settings
------------

The first thing to understand is that there are currently two supported methods
for URL formation: *relative* and *absolute*. Relative URLs are useful
when testing locally, and absolute URLs are reliable and most useful when
publishing. One method of supporting both is to have one Pelican configuration
file for local development and another for publishing. To see an example of this
type of setup, use the ``pelican-quickstart`` script as described at the top of
the :doc:`Getting Started <getting_started>` page, which will produce two separate
configuration files for local development and publishing, respectively.

You can customize the URLs and locations where files will be saved. The
``*_URL`` and ``*_SAVE_AS`` variables use Python's format strings. These
variables allow you to place your articles in a location such as
``{slug}/index.html`` and link to them as ``{slug}`` for clean URLs. These
settings give you the flexibility to place your articles and pages anywhere you
want.

.. note::
    If you specify a ``datetime`` directive, it will be substituted using the
    input files' date metadata attribute. If the date is not specified for a
    particular file, Pelican will rely on the file's ``mtime`` timestamp.

Check the Python datetime documentation at http://bit.ly/cNcJUC for more
information.

Also, you can use other file metadata attributes as well:

* slug
* date
* lang
* author
* category

Example usage:

* ARTICLE_URL = ``'posts/{date:%Y}/{date:%b}/{date:%d}/{slug}/'``
* ARTICLE_SAVE_AS = ``'posts/{date:%Y}/{date:%b}/{date:%d}/{slug}/index.html'``

This would save your articles in something like ``/posts/2011/Aug/07/sample-post/index.html``,
and the URL to this would be ``/posts/2011/Aug/07/sample-post/``.

Pelican can optionally create per-year, per-month, and per-day archives of your
posts. These secondary archives are disabled by default but are automatically
enabled if you supply format strings for their respective ``_SAVE_AS`` settings.
Period archives fit intuitively with the hierarchical model of web URLs and can
make it easier for readers to navigate through the posts you've written over time.

Example usage:

* YEAR_ARCHIVE_SAVE_AS = ``'posts/{date:%Y}/index.html'``
* MONTH_ARCHIVE_SAVE_AS = ``'posts/{date:%Y}/{date:%b}/index.html'``

With these settings, Pelican will create an archive of all your posts for the
year at (for instance) ``posts/2011/index.html`` and an archive of all your
posts for the month at ``posts/2011/Aug/index.html``.

.. note::
    Period archives work best when the final path segment is ``index.html``.
    This way a reader can remove a portion of your URL and automatically
    arrive at an appropriate archive of posts, without having to specify
    a page name.

====================================================    =====================================================

.. note::

    If you do not want one or more of the default pages to be created (e.g.,
    you are the only author on your site and thus do not need an Authors page),
    set the corresponding ``*_SAVE_AS`` setting to ``None`` to prevent the
    relevant page from being generated.

`DIRECT_TEMPLATES`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These templates (``('index', 'tags', 'categories', 'archives')`` by default)
works a bit differently than above. Only the ``_SAVE_AS`` setting is available:

=============================================  ===============================================
Setting name (default value)                   What does it do?
=============================================  ===============================================
`ARCHIVES_SAVE_AS` (``'archives.html'``)       The location to save the article archives page.
`AUTHORS_SAVE_AS` (``'authors.html'``)         The location to save the author list.
`CATEGORIES_SAVE_AS` (``'categories.html'``)   The location to save the category list.
`TAGS_SAVE_AS` (``'tags.html'``)               The location to save the tag list.
=============================================  ===============================================

The corresponding urls are hard-coded in the themes: ``'archives.html'``,
``'authors.html'``, ``'categories.html'``, ``'tags.html'``.

Timezone
--------

If no timezone is defined, UTC is assumed. This means that the generated Atom
and RSS feeds will contain incorrect date information if your locale is not UTC.

Pelican issues a warning in case this setting is not defined, as it was not
mandatory in previous versions.

Have a look at `the wikipedia page`_ to get a list of valid timezone values.

Date format and locale
----------------------

If no ``DATE_FORMATS`` are set, Pelican will fall back to
``DEFAULT_DATE_FORMAT``. If you need to maintain multiple languages with
different date formats, you can set the ``DATE_FORMATS`` dictionary using the
language name (``lang`` metadata in your post content) as the key. Regarding
available format codes, see `strftime document of python`_ :

.. parsed-literal::

    DATE_FORMATS = {
        'en': '%a, %d %b %Y',
        'jp': '%Y-%m-%d(%a)',
    }

You can set locale to further control date format:

.. parsed-literal::

    LOCALE = ('usa', 'jpn',  # On Windows
        'en_US', 'ja_JP'     # On Unix/Linux
        )

Also, it is possible to set different locale settings for each language. If you
put (locale, format) tuples in the dict, this will override the ``LOCALE``
setting above:

.. parsed-literal::
    # On Unix/Linux
    DATE_FORMATS = {
        'en': ('en_US','%a, %d %b %Y'),
        'jp': ('ja_JP','%Y-%m-%d(%a)'),
    }

    # On Windows
    DATE_FORMATS = {
        'en': ('usa','%a, %d %b %Y'),
        'jp': ('jpn','%Y-%m-%d(%a)'),
    }

This is a list of available `locales on Windows`_ . On Unix/Linux, usually you
can get a list of available locales via the ``locale -a`` command; see manpage
`locale(1)`_ for more information.

Template pages
==============

If you want to generate custom pages besides your blog entries, you can point
any Jinja2 template file with a path pointing to the file and the destination
path for the generated file.

For instance, if you have a blog with three static pages — a list of books,
your resume, and a contact page — you could have::

    TEMPLATE_PAGES = {'src/books.html': 'dest/books.html',
                      'src/resume.html': 'dest/resume.html',
                      'src/contact.html': 'dest/contact.html'}

Path metadata
=============

Not all metadata needs to be `embedded in source file itself`__.  For
example, blog posts are often named following a ``YYYY-MM-DD-SLUG.rst``
pattern, or nested into ``YYYY/MM/DD-SLUG`` directories.  To extract
metadata from the filename or path, set ``FILENAME_METADATA`` or
``PATH_METADATA`` to regular expressions that use Python's `group name
notation`_ ``(?P<name>…)``.  If you want to attach additional metadata
but don't want to encode it in the path, you can set
``EXTRA_PATH_METADATA``:

.. parsed-literal::

    EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {
        'relative/path/to/file-1': {
            'key-1a': 'value-1a',
            'key-1b': 'value-1b',
            },
        'relative/path/to/file-2': {
            'key-2': 'value-2',
            },
        }

This can be a convenient way to shift the installed location of a
particular file:

.. parsed-literal::

    # Take advantage of the following defaults
    # STATIC_SAVE_AS = '{path}'
    # STATIC_URL = '{path}'
    STATIC_PATHS = [
        'extra/robots.txt',
        ]
    EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {
        'extra/robots.txt': {'path': 'robots.txt'},
        }

Feed settings
=============

By default, Pelican uses Atom feeds. However, it is also possible to use RSS
feeds if you prefer.

Pelican generates category feeds as well as feeds for all your articles. It does
not generate feeds for tags by default, but it is possible to do so using
the ``TAG_FEED_ATOM`` and ``TAG_FEED_RSS`` settings:

================================================    =====================================================
Setting name (default value)                        What does it do?
================================================    =====================================================
`FEED_DOMAIN` (``None``, i.e. base URL is "/")      The domain prepended to feed URLs. Since feed URLs
                                                    should always be absolute, it is highly recommended
                                                    to define this (e.g., "http://feeds.example.com"). If
                                                    you have already explicitly defined SITEURL (see
                                                    above) and want to use the same domain for your
                                                    feeds, you can just set:  ``FEED_DOMAIN = SITEURL``.
`FEED_ATOM` (``None``, i.e. no Atom feed)           Relative URL to output the Atom feed.
`FEED_RSS` (``None``, i.e. no RSS)                  Relative URL to output the RSS feed.
`FEED_ALL_ATOM` (``'feeds/all.atom.xml'``)          Relative URL to output the all posts Atom feed:
                                                    this feed will contain all posts regardless of their
                                                    language.
`FEED_ALL_RSS` (``None``, i.e. no all RSS)          Relative URL to output the all posts RSS feed:
                                                    this feed will contain all posts regardless of their
                                                    language.
`CATEGORY_FEED_ATOM` ('feeds/%s.atom.xml'[2]_)      Where to put the category Atom feeds.
`CATEGORY_FEED_RSS` (``None``, i.e. no RSS)         Where to put the category RSS feeds.
`TAG_FEED_ATOM` (``None``, i.e. no tag feed)        Relative URL to output the tag Atom feed. It should
                                                    be defined using a "%s" match in the tag name.
`TAG_FEED_RSS` (``None``, ie no RSS tag feed)       Relative URL to output the tag RSS feed
`FEED_MAX_ITEMS`                                    Maximum number of items allowed in a feed. Feed item
                                                    quantity is unrestricted by default.
================================================    =====================================================

If you don't want to generate some or any of these feeds, set the above variables to ``None``.

.. [2] %s is the name of the category.

FeedBurner
----------

If you want to use FeedBurner for your feed, you will likely need to decide
upon a unique identifier. For example, if your site were called "Thyme" and
hosted on the www.example.com domain, you might use "thymefeeds" as your
unique identifier, which we'll use throughout this section for illustrative
purposes. In your Pelican settings, set the `FEED_ATOM` attribute to
"thymefeeds/main.xml" to create an Atom feed with an original address of
`http://www.example.com/thymefeeds/main.xml`. Set the `FEED_DOMAIN` attribute
to `http://feeds.feedburner.com`, or `http://feeds.example.com` if you are
using a CNAME on your own domain (i.e., FeedBurner's "MyBrand" feature).

There are two fields to configure in the `FeedBurner
<http://feedburner.google.com>`_ interface: "Original Feed" and "Feed
Address". In this example, the "Original Feed" would be
`http://www.example.com/thymefeeds/main.xml` and the "Feed Address" suffix
would be `thymefeeds/main.xml`.

Pagination
==========

The default behaviour of Pelican is to list all the article titles along
with a short description on the index page. While this works well for
small-to-medium sites, sites with a large quantity of articles will probably
benefit from paginating this list.

You can use the following settings to configure the pagination.

================================================    =====================================================
Setting name (default value)                        What does it do?
================================================    =====================================================
`DEFAULT_ORPHANS` (``0``)                           The minimum number of articles allowed on the
                                                    last page. Use this when you don't want the last page
                                                    to only contain a handful of articles.
`DEFAULT_PAGINATION` (``False``)                    The maximum number of articles to include on a
                                                    page, not including orphans. False to disable
                                                    pagination.
`PAGINATION_PATTERNS`                               A set of patterns that are used to determine advanced
                                                    pagination output.
================================================    =====================================================

Using Pagination Patterns
-------------------------

The ``PAGINATION_PATTERNS`` setting can be used to configure where
subsequent pages are created. The setting is a sequence of three
element tuples, where each tuple consists of::

  (minimum page, URL setting, SAVE_AS setting,)

For example, if you wanted the first page to just be ``/``, and the
second (and subsequent) pages to be ``/page/2/``, you would set
``PAGINATION_PATTERNS`` as follows::

  PAGINATION_PATTERNS = (
      (1, '{base_name}/', '{base_name}/index.html'),
      (2, '{base_name}/page/{number}/', '{base_name}/page/{number}/index.html'),
  )

This would cause the first page to be written to
``{base_name}/index.html``, and subsequent ones would be written into
``page/{number}`` directories.

Tag cloud
=========

If you want to generate a tag cloud with all your tags, you can do so using the
following settings.

================================================    =====================================================
Setting name (default value)                        What does it do?
================================================    =====================================================
`TAG_CLOUD_STEPS` (``4``)                           Count of different font sizes in the tag
                                                    cloud.
`TAG_CLOUD_MAX_ITEMS` (``100``)                     Maximum number of tags in the cloud.
================================================    =====================================================

The default theme does not include a tag cloud, but it is pretty easy to add one::

    <ul class="tagcloud">
        {% for tag in tag_cloud %}
            <li class="tag-{{ tag.1 }}"><a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ tag.0.url }}">{{ tag.0 }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>

You should then also define CSS styles with appropriate classes (tag-1 to tag-N,
where N matches ``TAG_CLOUD_STEPS``), tag-1 being the most frequent, and
define a ``ul.tagcloud`` class with appropriate list-style to create the cloud.
For example::

    ul.tagcloud {
      list-style: none;
        padding: 0;
    }

    ul.tagcloud li {
        display: inline-block;
    }

    li.tag-1 {
        font-size: 150%;
    }

    li.tag-2 {
        font-size: 120%;
    }

    ...

Translations
============

Pelican offers a way to translate articles. See the :doc:`Getting Started <getting_started>` section for
more information.

=====================================================    =====================================================
Setting name (default value)                             What does it do?
=====================================================    =====================================================
`DEFAULT_LANG` (``'en'``)                                The default language to use.
`TRANSLATION_FEED_ATOM` ('feeds/all-%s.atom.xml'[3]_)    Where to put the Atom feed for translations.
`TRANSLATION_FEED_RSS` (``None``, i.e. no RSS)           Where to put the RSS feed for translations.
=====================================================    =====================================================

.. [3] %s is the language

Ordering content
=================

================================================    =====================================================
Setting name (default value)                        What does it do?
================================================    =====================================================
`NEWEST_FIRST_ARCHIVES` (``True``)                  Order archives by newest first by date. (False:
                                                    orders by date with older articles first.)
`REVERSE_CATEGORY_ORDER` (``False``)                Reverse the category order. (True: lists by reverse
                                                    alphabetical order; default lists alphabetically.)
================================================    =====================================================

Themes
======

Creating Pelican themes is addressed in a dedicated section (see :ref:`theming-pelican`).
However, here are the settings that are related to themes.

================================================    =====================================================
Setting name (default value)                        What does it do?
================================================    =====================================================
`THEME`                                             Theme to use to produce the output. Can be a relative
                                                    or absolute path to a theme folder, or the name of a
                                                    default theme or a theme installed via
                                                    ``pelican-themes`` (see below).
`THEME_STATIC_DIR` (``'theme'``)                    Destination directory in the output path where
                                                    Pelican will place the files collected from
                                                    `THEME_STATIC_PATHS`. Default is `theme`.
`THEME_STATIC_PATHS` (``['static']``)               Static theme paths you want to copy. Default
                                                    value is `static`, but if your theme has
                                                    other static paths, you can put them here. If files
                                                    or directories with the same names are included in
                                                    the paths defined in this settings, they will be
                                                    progressively overwritten.
`CSS_FILE` (``'main.css'``)                         Specify the CSS file you want to load.
================================================    =====================================================


By default, two themes are available. You can specify them using the `THEME` setting or by passing the
``-t`` option to the ``pelican`` command:

* notmyidea
* simple (a synonym for "plain text" :)

There are a number of other themes available at http://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes.
Pelican comes with :doc:`pelican-themes`, a small script for managing themes.

You can define your own theme, either by starting from scratch or by duplicating
and modifying a pre-existing theme. Here is :doc:`a guide on how to create your theme <themes>`.

Following are example ways to specify your preferred theme::

    # Specify name of a built-in theme
    THEME = "notmyidea"
    # Specify name of a theme installed via the pelican-themes tool
    THEME = "chunk"
    # Specify a customized theme, via path relative to the settings file
    THEME = "themes/mycustomtheme"
    # Specify a customized theme, via absolute path
    THEME = "~/projects/mysite/themes/mycustomtheme"

The built-in ``notmyidea`` theme can make good use of the following settings. Feel
free to use them in your themes as well.

=======================   =======================================================
Setting name              What does it do ?
=======================   =======================================================
`SITESUBTITLE`            A subtitle to appear in the header.
`DISQUS_SITENAME`         Pelican can handle Disqus comments. Specify the
                          Disqus sitename identifier here.
`GITHUB_URL`              Your GitHub URL (if you have one). It will then
                          use this information to create a GitHub ribbon.
`GOOGLE_ANALYTICS`        'UA-XXXX-YYYY' to activate Google Analytics.
`GOSQUARED_SITENAME`      'XXX-YYYYYY-X' to activate GoSquared.
`MENUITEMS`               A list of tuples (Title, URL) for additional menu
                          items to appear at the beginning of the main menu.
`PIWIK_URL`               URL to your Piwik server - without 'http://' at the
                          beginning.
`PIWIK_SSL_URL`           If the SSL-URL differs from the normal Piwik-URL
                          you have to include this setting too. (optional)
`PIWIK_SITE_ID`           ID for the monitored website. You can find the ID
                          in the Piwik admin interface > settings > websites.
`LINKS`                   A list of tuples (Title, URL) for links to appear on
                          the header.
`SOCIAL`                  A list of tuples (Title, URL) to appear in the
                          "social" section.
`TWITTER_USERNAME`        Allows for adding a button to articles to encourage
                          others to tweet about them. Add your Twitter username
                          if you want this button to appear.
=======================   =======================================================

In addition, you can use the "wide" version of the ``notmyidea`` theme by
adding the following to your configuration::

    CSS_FILE = "wide.css"
