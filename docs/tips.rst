Here are some tips about Pelican that you might find useful.

Publishing to GitHub
====================

GitHub comes with an interesting "pages" feature: you can upload things there
and it will be available directly from their servers. As Pelican is a static
file generator, we can take advantage of this.

User Pages
----------
GitHub allows you to create user pages in the form of ``username.github.com``. 
Whatever is created in the master branch will be published. For this purpose,
just the output generated by Pelican needs to pushed to GitHub.

So given a repository containing your articles, just run Pelican over the posts 
and deploy the master branch to GitHub::

    $ pelican -s pelican.conf.py ./path/to/posts -o /path/to/output

Now add all the files in the output directory generated by Pelican::

    $ git add /path/to/output/*
    $ git commit -am "Your Message"
    $ git push origin master

Project Pages
-------------
For creating Project pages, a branch called ``gh-pages`` is used for publishing.
The excellent `ghp-import <https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import>`_ makes this
really easy, which can be installed via::

    $ pip install ghp-import

Then, given a repository containing your articles, you would simply run 
Pelican and upload the output to GitHub::

    $ pelican -s pelican.conf.py .
    $ ghp-import output
    $ git push origin gh-pages

And that's it.

If you want, you can put that directly into a post-commit hook, so each time you
commit, your blog is up-to-date on GitHub!

Put the following into ``.git/hooks/post-commit``::

    pelican -s pelican.conf.py . && ghp-import output && git push origin gh-pages
