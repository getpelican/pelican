"Starting with version 4.5, Pelican moved to a new plugin structure "
"utilizing namespace packages that can be easily installed via Pip_. "
"Plugins supporting this structure will install under the namespace "
"package ``pelican.plugins`` and can be automatically discovered by "
"Pelican. To see a list of Pip-installed namespace plugins that are active"
" in your environment, run::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugins.rst:20
msgid ""
"If you leave the ``PLUGINS`` setting as default (``None``), Pelican will "
"automatically discover namespace plugins and register them. If, on the "
"other hand, you specify a ``PLUGINS`` setting as a list of plugins, this "
"auto-discovery will be disabled. At that point, only the plugins you "
"specify will be registered, and you must explicitly list any namespace "
"plugins as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugins.rst:26

"If you are using the ``PLUGINS`` setting, you can specify plugins in two "
"ways. The first method specifies plugins as a list of strings. Namespace "
"plugins can be specified either by their full names "
"(``pelican.plugins.myplugin``) or by their short names (``myplugin``)::"

"When experimenting with different plugins (especially the ones that deal "
"with metadata and content) caching may interfere and the changes may not "

"False`` or use the ``--ignore-cache`` command-line switch."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugins.rst:48

"If your plugins are not in an importable path, you can specify a list of "

"Namespace plugins can be found in the `pelican-plugins organization`_ as "

"Plugins are based on the concept of signals. Pelican sends signals, and "
"plugins subscribe to those signals. The list of available signals is "
"documented in a subsequent section."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugins.rst:76
msgid ""
"The only rule to follow for plugins is to define a ``register`` callable,"
" in which you map the signals to your plugin logic. Let's take a simple "
"example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugins.rst:93
msgid ""
"Signal receivers are weakly-referenced and thus must not be defined "
"within your ``register`` callable or they will be garbage-collected "
"before the signal is emitted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugins.rst:97
msgid ""
"If multiple plugins connect to the same signal, there is no way to "
"guarantee or control in which order the plugins will be executed. This is"
" a limitation inherited from Blinker_, the dependency Pelican uses to "
"implement signals."

msgid "Namespace plugin structure"
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugins.rst:104
msgid ""
"Namespace plugins must adhere to a certain structure in order to function"
" properly. They need to be installable (i.e. contain ``setup.py`` or "
"equivalent) and have a folder structure as follows::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugins.rst:117
msgid ""
"It is crucial that ``pelican`` or ``pelican/plugins`` folder **not** "
"contain an ``__init__.py`` file. In fact, it is best to have those "
"folders empty besides the listed folders in the above structure and keep "
"your plugin related files contained solely in the "
"``pelican/plugins/myplugin`` folder to avoid any issues."
