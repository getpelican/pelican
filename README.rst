Pelican
#######

Pelican is a simple weblog generator, written in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_.

* Write your weblog entries directly with your editor of choice (vim!) and
  directly in `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_, or `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_.
* A simple cli-tool to (re)generate the weblog.
* Easy to interface with DVCSes and web hooks
* Completely static output, so easy to host anywhere !

Features
--------

Pelican currently supports:

* blog articles
* comments, via an external service (disqus). Please notice that while
  it's useful, it's an external service, and you'll not manage the
  comments by yourself. It could potentially eat your data.
* theming support (themes are done using `jinja2 <http://jinjna.pocoo.org>`_)
* PDF generation of the articles/pages (optional).

Have a look to `the documentation <http://alexis.notmyidea.org/pelican/>`_ for
more informations.

Why the name "Pelican" ?
------------------------

Heh, you didn't noticed? "Pelican" is an anagram for "Calepin" ;)
